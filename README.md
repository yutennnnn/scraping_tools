# Scraping Tools

This repository contains simple scrapers for Alibaba and Mercari.

## Private Code

The scripts expect a `private_code.py` file to be present in the project
root. This file can contain any functions or data that you prefer not to
share publicly, such as API keys or helper functions.

`private_code.py` is listed in `.gitignore` so it will not be committed.
Create your own version of this file before running the scrapers.
